		At this point, all output is to the debug console (F12 on
		Firefox, probably the same on Chrome). Currently, the only
		supported controllers are the flight sticks. Connect two of
		them (or, if they are already connected, press a button on each
		of them) to activate them. Then (when the code is finished) use
		them to control the robot.
